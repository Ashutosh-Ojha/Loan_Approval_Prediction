# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting loan approval chances using machine learning techniques. A variety of classifiers, including Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, were implemented to achieve accurate predictions.

## Project Highlights

- **Prediction Model:** Developed a robust machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn to predict loan approval, achieving up to 70% accuracy.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Implemented advanced data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, ensuring high-quality input for the model.

- **Model Evaluation and Optimization:** Conducted a thorough evaluation of multiple classifiers, optimizing for accuracy and contributing to informed decision-making processes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages can be installed using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Install the required packages.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Loan_Approval_Prediction.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to understand the data, preprocess it, and train machine learning models.
